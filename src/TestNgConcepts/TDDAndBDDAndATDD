	1.3. Write test cases before code is written
	i.e Author is the Developer.

	1.5. Key Focus -> Is my code working correctly

	1.6 TDD Cycle

	1.6.1. Test Fails (Write the Test Fails)

	1.6.2. Test Passed(Make the code works)

	1.6.3. Refactor(Improve the code)



    2.BDD - Behavior Driven Development

	2.2. Works on higher level of abstraction as compared to TDD

	2.3. Always ask -> have we covered all the possible Scenarios(Examples)?
